# About

TinyDJ is an open-source, [ATMega32u4](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ATMEGA32U4) powered, mini DJ controller. This repository will document the making of this project and will provide all the information required to make your own.

# Plans/Goals

- ~~As close to the size of a credit card as possible~~ DONE
- Control most major DJ software, such as [Rekordbox](https://rekordbox.com/en/), [Serato](https://serato.com/) and [DJay Pro](https://www.algoriddim.com/djay-ios) for iOS for a portable real-life use case.
- ~~Remove need for Arduino~~ Now using ATMega32u4
